# University Malaya Statistics Case Study

This repository contains coursework for the University Malaya Statistics case study, focusing on fraud detection using real-world transaction data. The project demonstrates data exploration, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling using Python.

## Features
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Correlation analysis and visualization
- Logistic regression modeling
- Interpretation of statistical results
- Visualizations and plots generated in Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
```
project/
  main.ipynb           # Main analysis notebook
  requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
  datasets/
    card_transdata.csv # Transaction data
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd statistics_case_study/project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells sequentially.

## Visualizations
All plots and analysis outputs are available in the notebook. If you wish to display notebook images in this README, you can export the desired plot as a PNG (right-click the image in Jupyter and save), then reference it like this:
